# 🌸 Mariam & Abdelrahman Calculator

Special calculator project.

I built this for my niece **Mariam** and my nephew **Abdelrahman**.

Instead of creating two different calculators — one for boys and one for girls —  
I designed a single calculator with **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode**, so each of them can choose what they like.

🌸 Light Mode → Mariam Mode (Scientific version)  
🌙 Dark Mode → Abdelrahman Mode (Simplified version)

## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted them to see that programming isn’t abstract.

Calculators, games, apps — everything around us is powered by logic and code.

While building this, I researched how operations like factorial and trigonometric functions work behind the scenes instead of just using them.

The goal was simple:
Make them curious about how things work.
